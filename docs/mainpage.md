SAIGE-QTL is an R package developed with Rcpp for scalable and accurate expression quantitative trait locus mapping for single-cell studies at the single-cell resolution

The method
- Model repeat and complex data structure, due to multiple cells per individual and relatedness between individuals
- Model discrete read counts
- Fast and scalable for large data, test 20k genes, 200 cell types, millions of cells, millions of variants
- Test rare variations. Single-variant test is underpowered


The package takes genotype file input in the following formats
- PLINK (bed, bim, fam), BGEN, VCF, BCF, SAV
